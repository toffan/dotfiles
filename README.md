# dotfiles

Some of my dotfiles

## Disclaimers

### awesome

This part is greatly inspired (if not entirely copied) from [this
repo](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats). Go look at it, you
will find great stuff.

### bin/replace

This executable is taken from the package `mariadb`. Because I don't want to
install the whole package as a dependency I have just copied `replace` into my
dotfiles.
